## Overview

**The purpose of this analysis is to put together a presentation for an angel investor and provide them with a deeper look into the New York City Citibike Bikesharing program. The visualization is intended to show the investor how the model could work in Des Moines, Iowa.**
**The presentations that have been put together include:**
**Length of time bikes are rented for all genders**
**Number of trips by all genders during the week**
**Repair Data for Bikes**
**Most favored locations by tourists and users**

## Resources
Tableau, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library

**Most Popular Trip Origin Locations** This visualization shows the most popular trip starting locations for users in the New York City area. The locations with most origins indicates that these are favored by locals and tourists alike. This will help in determining the hot spots where enough bikes should be available for users at all times.


![Checkout Durations](https://github.com/fouadZiaa/bikeSharing/blob/2a60647edf1b8ee8405104820684b82097b0dbdf/Images/Checkout%20Durations.png)

Looking at these two visualizations for **Checkout Times for Users** and **Checkout Times by Gender**, we gather that a large number of rides only last roughly 20 or so minutes. It is safe to conclude that a vast number of trips last less than an hour. Results remain consistent regardless of gender.

**Trips By Weekday per Hour** are shown in the heatmap above. A clear pattern can be observed that moring and evening commutes except wednesdays are the heavy use windows.

**User Trips by Gender by Weekday** heatmap tells us that subscribers are mostly male and account for the bulk of the weekday trips. Often times customers' genders are unknown and weekend trips are evenly split between customers and subscribers.

![Bike Utilization](https://github.com/fouadZiaa/bikeSharing/blob/9246ada469601b053cdb29b7e38db6910d4cce44/Images/Bike%20Repairs.png)
**Bike Utilization and Repairs** chart shows which bikes are more heavily used and the number of hours they are in service and which ones get used less frequently. This can help in rotating bikes from heavy to light usage and keep the maintenance costs low.


![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/fouadZiaa/bikeSharing/blob/bce5b89e6b095b6223da2f8a012ef7b9e6a58071/Images/Trips%20by%20Gender.png)
**Trips By Gender by Weekday** heatmap tells us that useage pattern is true regardless of gender. Case in point that total number of males is on the higher end.
